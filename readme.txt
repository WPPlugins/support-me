Allows you to generate expireable user accounts for support purposes.

== Description ==

Sometimes you just need some help, and when you're working privately with support personnel for a plugin or theme, creating temporary admin accounts can be a pain.

Support Me makes creating accounts for support purposes a snap:

* You can set support accounts to expire after a set number of minutes, hours, or days, or even not expire at all.
* Once a support account expires, it is automatically deleted.
* No more making up fake email addresses or dealing with the full user registration process. Just set an expiration, and generate an account.
* You can manage support account sessions just like any other user account.
* Easily see when Support Accounts expire in a new 'Expires' column on the Users screen

And don't worry about Support Accounts overreaching their bounds on your website. All support accounts are granted full admin privileges with the caveat that they can't create, edit, promote, or delete other users.

Support Me is also fully compatible with debugging plugins such as Debug Bar, ensuring support personnel can help you solve your problems faster so you can get back to work.

<strong>Note: Support Me requires a minimum of PHP 5.3 to be running on your web host.</strong> Help move plugin developers and WordPress forward into modern PHP by asking your host to upgrade you today.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin realy require a minimum of PHP 5.3? Why? =

Modern coding practices demand the ability to leverage modern techniques. The leap in functionality and speed between PHP 5.2 and modern versions like 5.6 or 7 are exponential.
